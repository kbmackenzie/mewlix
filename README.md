**Mewlix** is a cat-themed [esoteric programming language][5] that compiles to vanilla JavaScript. It's designed for making little HTML5 games!

Mewlix's compiler is written in pure Haskell, and is a self-contained binary executable. It can build projects, run them in a simple HTTP server, and package the build output neatly into a `.zip` file for upload in websites like [itch.io][6].

As is tradition for all languages, here's a simple `'hello world'` program in Mewlix:

```mewlix
meow "Hello world!"
```

*And* here's how to draw a sprite to the canvas in `graphic` mode:

```mewlix
from std.graphic takes load, draw, init

üê± draw_cat()
  do draw <- "cat", 0, 0
~meow

do load <- "cat", "path/to/cat.png"
do init <- draw_cat
```

It has...
 
- Cat-themed syntax!
- A stack-like, LIFO [persistent data structure][7]‚Äîaffectionately nicknamed a *'shelf'*.
- String interpolation‚Äî`:3"like [this]!"`‚Äîaffectionately nicknamed *'yarn strings'*.
- Lambda functions, defined like this: `üêà (a, b) -> a + b`
- Classes, affectionately nicknamed *'clowders'*.
- A function composition operator (`:>`) and a function application operator (`|>`).
- Feline-oriented programming capabilities.

## Special Thanks

A big special thanks to my friend Jade for helping me stay sane through this project and for letting me talk endlessly about it these past few months. I wouldn't have been able to finish it without you, thank you! ‚ô°
